## AI BEHAVIOUR sub-domain — LOCOMOTION. Owns the NavigationAgent2D and turns a target point into
## steering on the character: `move_to()` writes `character.move_input` to follow a navigated path
## around walls and furniture and through doorways. The navmesh (baked by the Navigation domain)
## carves out furniture and rings the house with a walkable outdoor strip, so paths route around a
## piece and reroute through another doorway when one is blocked.
##
## Steering always aims at the next navmesh waypoint, so the character's own push physics bulldoze
## furniture sitting on the route without ever tunnelling a wall. It is behaviour's movement tool
## only — it holds no decision or combat state. Falls back to straight-line steering when there is
## no nav agent.

## How close (px) counts as "arrived" when steering straight-line (no nav agent).

## line steering).

## Snap a world point onto the navigation mesh so it is actually reachable — a room's geometric
## centre is often inside furniture (off the navmesh), which would make the nav agent treat it as
## unreachable and wedge the NPC trying to shove toward it. Returns `p` unchanged with no nav agent.

## Read-only: the pathing state behind the current move, for the AI's `debug_state()` snapshot. Uses
## only side-effect-free agent reads — notably NOT `get_next_path_position()`, which advances the
## agent's path index and so would perturb movement if called out of band by an observer. `next` is
## therefore read off the path array at the live index instead.
